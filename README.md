# Capstone projects
Thinkful Data Science projects

For my Data Science Immersive Program, I completed a project notebook illustrating my knowledge of the topics as the course progressed.
Topics:
  * Experimental Design A/B Testing
  * Supervised Machine Learning
  * Unsupervised Machine Learning


# Capstone 1
The first topic is Experimental Design A/B Testing. The purpose was to test a hypothesis using statistical hypothesis testing algorithms i.e. Normality tests, Correlation tests, and Parametric/Non-Parametric tests as well as illustrations to prove or disprove your hypothesis.

I chose a dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/newamerica/terrorist-activity.
The data in the report consists of individuals who are accused of terrorism within the United States since 9/11. They are either American citizens or those who engaged in terrorist activity in the United States. The data is divided into plots and suspects. I focused on the suspects dataset performing an experiment that tested whether a suspect had been radicalized online or not.

The second topic is Supervised Machine Learning. The purpose was to create a specific research question to perform supervised machine learning algorithms on a dataset and
