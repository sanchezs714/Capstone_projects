Thinkful Data Science projects

For my Data Science Immersive Program, I completed different capstones to illustrate my knowledge of the subject as the class advanced.
For the 3 listed, they demonstrate my expertise on Experimental Design A/B testing, Supervised Machine Learning, and Unsupervised Machine Learning.
All of the data came from datasets on Kaggle.
