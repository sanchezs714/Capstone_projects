# Capstone projects
Thinkful Data Science projects

For my Data Science Immersive Program, I completed a project notebook illustrating my knowledge of the topics as the course progressed.
Topics:
  * Experimental Design A/B Testing
  * Supervised Machine Learning
  * Unsupervised Machine Learning


# Capstone 1
The first topic is Experimental Design A/B Testing. The purpose was to test a hypothesis using statistical hypothesis testing algorithms i.e. Normality tests, Correlation tests, and Parametric/Non-Parametric tests as well as illustrations to prove or disprove your hypothesis.

I chose a dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/newamerica/terrorist-activity.
The data in the report consists of individuals who are accused of terrorism within the United States since 9/11. They are either American citizens or those who engaged in terrorist activity in the United States. The data is divided into plots and suspects. I focused on the suspects dataset performing an experiment that tested whether a suspect had been radicalized online or not.

# Capstone 2
The second topic is Supervised Machine Learning. The purpose was to create a specific research question in order to execute either classification or regression supervised machine learning algorithms on a dataset and then modify one to achieve the best performance. 

I chose a dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/alukosayoenoch/cyber-security-breaches-data. 
The data in the report consists of several covered entities that experienced a breach in their systems. In order to perform the algorithms, I created a binary column that labeled the breaches as theft True or False filtering every value that consisted "theft" in the Type of Breach data. Then, I proceeded to implement classification models to the data.
